# Active Context: Zoho Webhook Integration

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on setting up and documenting the Zoho webhook integration for TELUS partners. This includes:

1. Finalizing the Google Apps Script implementation for sending lead data to Zoho CRM
2. Documenting the setup and usage process for partners
3. Creating a streamlined workflow for partners to request access and transition from sandbox to production

## Recent Changes

1. **Script Implementation**:
   - Implemented error handling for missing configuration values
   - Added logging for better troubleshooting
   - Improved phone number formatting to ensure compliance with API requirements
   - Added record ID and timestamp tracking for successful submissions
   - **FIXED**: Webhook response parsing logic to correctly extract record ID and timestamp from Zoho API response

2. **Bug Fix - Webhook Response Parsing**:
   - Issue: Script was looking for record ID in `responseData.details.output` structure that didn't exist
   - Actual response structure: `responseData.data[0].details.id`
   - Solution: Updated parsing logic to match actual Zoho webhook response format
   - Result: Record ID and timestamp now properly stored in Google Sheet columns 17 and 18

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive README with webhook details and API parameters
   - Documented the approval process for partners
   - Added example JSON payload for testing

4. **Process Improvements**:
   - Established a clear workflow for sandbox testing and production transition
   - Created email templates for partner communication
   - Set up support channels for technical and non-technical inquiries

## Next Steps

1. **Partner Onboarding**:
   - Create step-by-step guide for partners to set up the integration
   - Develop training materials for partner technical teams
   - Establish monitoring process for new partner requests

2. **Technical Enhancements**:
   - Implement additional data validation for required fields
   - Add support for custom field mapping
   - Create a more robust error recovery mechanism

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - Create FAQ section based on partner feedback
   - Document best practices for data entry

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Authentication Approach**:
   - Decision: Using partner-specific tokens for authentication
   - Consideration: Balances security with ease of implementation
   - Alternative considered: OAuth2 (rejected due to complexity for partners)

2. **Trigger Mechanism**:
   - Decision: Using onEdit trigger for real-time processing
   - Consideration: Ensures immediate data transmission
   - Alternative considered: Time-based trigger (rejected due to potential delays)

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Decision: Logging errors and updating sheet with status
   - Consideration: Provides visibility into issues for troubleshooting
   - Future enhancement: Email notifications for failed submissions

4. **Environment Strategy**:
   - Decision: Sandbox testing followed by production deployment
   - Consideration: Allows partners to validate integration before going live
   - Implementation: Different webhook URLs for sandbox and production

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Single-purpose functions with clear responsibilities
   - Extensive logging for troubleshooting
   - Configuration variables at the top of the script

2. **Data Handling**:
   - Consistent column mapping between sheet and API
   - Data cleaning and formatting before transmission
   - Status tracking in dedicated columns

3. **Partner Communication**:
   - Clear documentation with examples
   - Dedicated support channels for different types of inquiries
   - Step-by-step guides for technical implementation

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **Partner Technical Capabilities**:
   - Partners have varying levels of technical expertise
   - Solution needs to be accessible to non-developers
   - Documentation must be comprehensive yet simple

2. **Data Quality Challenges**:
   - Phone number formatting varies widely
   - Required fields may not always be available
   - Date formats need standardization

3. **Integration Complexity**:
   - Google Apps Script has limitations for complex processing
   - Error handling is critical for reliability
   - Clear feedback mechanisms are essential for user confidence

4. **Support Requirements**:
   - Partners need both technical and process support
   - Common issues should be documented for self-service
   - Response time expectations should be clearly communicated
