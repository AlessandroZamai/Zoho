# **Dealer \- Approval Process**

To access the Zoho webhook please follow the below process:

1. Contact the Book of Business team to request access to the Zoho webhook by submitting a request on the Book of Business Partners page.  
   1. The Book of Business team will respond to your request and provide next steps.  
2. Once approved:  
   1. You’ll receive an email with a link to your organization’s testing authentication token (“auth\_token\_name” and “auth\_token\_value”). This link will expire after 7 days.
