# **Enhanced Organization-Specific Zoho Integration Setup Guide**

This guide explains how to set up and use the enhanced Zoho webhook integration that supports organization-specific configurations, multiple processing modes, and advanced lead assignment strategies.

## **What's New**

The integration now supports:

### **Processing Modes**
1. **Automated Processing**: Data is automatically sent to Zoho when you edit any cell
2. **Manual Processing**: Data is sent only when you click a button, with detailed progress tracking and error reporting

### **Organization Types**
1. **Corporate Store (KI)**: TELUS corporate-owned stores with predefined integration settings
2. **Dealership (DL)**: Independent dealer partners who manage their own integration credentials
3. **Mobile Klinik (RT)**: Mobile Klinik locations with predefined integration settings

### **Lead Assignment Strategies**
1. **Equal Distribution**: Distribute leads equally among store employees using Channel Outlet ID
2. **Manual Assignment**: Assign leads to specific sales representatives using email addresses
3. **Dealer Admin**: Automatically assign all leads to the dealer administrator

## **Initial Setup**

### **Step 1: Import Files to Google Apps Script**

1. Open your Google Spreadsheet
2. Go to `Extensions > Apps Script`
3. Import all the following files:
   - `send_to_webhook_script.gs` (updated)
   - `create_trigger_script.gs` (updated)
   - `setup_wizard.gs` (enhanced)
   - `setup_wizard_ui.html` (enhanced)
   - `manual_processing.gs` (enhanced)
   - `progress_dialog_ui.html` (unchanged)
   - `date_confirmation_dialog.html` (new)

### **Step 2: Configure Predefined Credentials (Admin Only)**

**For Corporate Store and Mobile Klinik organizations**, administrators need to set up predefined credentials in script properties:

1. In Apps Script, go to `Project Settings` > `Script Properties`
2. Add the following properties:
   - `AUTH_TOKEN_NAME_KI`: Corporate Store token name
   - `AUTH_TOKEN_VALUE_KI`: Corporate Store token value
   - `AUTH_TOKEN_NAME_RT`: Mobile Klinik token name
   - `AUTH_TOKEN_VALUE_RT`: Mobile Klinik token value

**Note**: Dealership users will enter their own credentials during setup.

### **Step 3: Run the Enhanced Setup Wizard**

1. In the Apps Script editor, select `showSetupWizard` from the function dropdown
2. Click the `Run` button
3. Grant necessary permissions when prompted
4. Follow the multi-step wizard:
   - **Step 1**: Choose your processing mode (Automated or Manual)
   - **Step 2**: Select your organization type
   - **Step 3**: Enter credentials (Dealership only)
   - **Step 4**: Configure campaign dates
   - **Step 5**: Choose lead assignment strategy

## **Organization-Specific Setup**

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **"Manual Processing Not Available"**
   - You're in automated processing mode
   - Run the setup wizard to switch to manual processing mode

2. **"Configuration Incomplete"**
   - Run the setup wizard to complete configuration
   - For Corporate Store/Mobile Klinik: Contact admin if predefined credentials are missing
   - For Dealership: Ensure all credential fields are filled

3. **"Predefined credentials not found"**
   - Corporate Store/Mobile Klinik only
   - Contact your administrator to set up AUTH_TOKEN_NAME_KI/RT and AUTH_TOKEN_VALUE_KI/RT

4. **Assignment Field Validation Errors**
   - **Channel Outlet ID**: Must be exactly 11 digits
   - **Sales Rep Email**: Must be valid email format
   - Check your lead assignment configuration

5. **Date Confirmation Issues**
   - Update campaign dates if processing on different dates
   - Ensure end date is after start date

6. **Column Formatting Issues**
   - Disabled columns appear grayed out - this is normal
   - Only enter data in enabled columns based on your assignment strategy

7. **No Menu Visible**
   - You might be in automated processing mode
   - Refresh the spreadsheet or run the setup wizard

8. **Data Not Sending in Automated Mode**
   - Check if you're editing enabled columns
   - Verify that your changes are triggering the onEdit event
   - Review Apps Script logs for any error messages

9. **Processing Mode Mismatch**
   - If automated processing isn't working, confirm your processing mode setting
   - Run the setup wizard to change processing mode if needed

### **Organization-Specific Troubleshooting**

**Corporate Store (KI)**:
- Ensure Channel Outlet ID is 11 digits for equal distribution
- Contact admin if predefined credentials are not working

**Dealership (DL)**:
- Verify your organization code is correct
- Check that your auth tokens are valid
- For dealer admin mode, no assignment fields are needed

**Mobile Klinik (RT)**:
- Ensure Channel Outlet ID is 11 digits for equal distribution
- Contact admin if predefined credentials are not working

### **Getting Help**

- Check the Apps Script execution logs for detailed error information
- Use the export log feature in the progress dialog to share results
- Include your organization type when contacting support
- Contact your technical support team with specific error messages

## **Backward Compatibility**

- Existing `createTrigger()` function is now mapped to set up automated processing mode
- Old automated behavior is preserved when using the original function
- All existing spreadsheets will continue to work without modification
- Legacy configurations are automatically detected and supported in the new system

## **Best Practices**

### **For Automated Processing Mode**
- Test thoroughly before deploying to production
- Monitor Apps Script logs regularly
- Ensure data quality before it reaches the spreadsheet
- Set up error notifications to catch issues quickly

### **For Manual Processing Mode**
- Review the progress dialog results before closing
- Use the export log feature to keep records of processing
- Fix validation errors promptly for better data quality
- Process data in reasonable batch sizes (recommended: under 50 rows at once)
- Regularly check for and process unsubmitted rows

### **General Best Practices**
- Regularly review and update your campaign dates
- Keep your organization-specific settings up to date
- Train users on the correct use of enabled columns based on your lead assignment strategy
- Periodically run the setup wizard to ensure your configuration is current

## **Technical Notes**

- Manual processing includes a 500ms delay between rows to prevent API rate limiting
- The progress dialog uses Google Apps Script's HtmlService for the user interface
- Configuration is stored using PropertiesService for persistence
- Both processing modes use the same underlying webhook API and data validation
- Automated processing uses Google Apps Script's onEdit trigger
- The system dynamically enables/disables columns based on the lead assignment strategy
- Error handling and logging are consistent across both processing modes
